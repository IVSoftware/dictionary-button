Your question is _**if there is a way to write shorter syntax for converters with Generic Types.**_ Your code (as I understand it) depicts an effort to map buttons to commands by identifying a generic type. But the mapping could be achieved with simpler mechanism, where any given generic type could specify the command mapping in its constructor. Here's what I mean.

Suppose you have a large number of `Button` (as shown here) or `ImageButton` or whatever. The first thing would be to make a custom version of the control and give it a static property that is a `Dictionary<string, ICommand>`. In essence, this is still a "converter" because it maps the `CommandParameter` to an `ICommand` directly.


```
using System.Windows.Input;
namespace dictionary_button.Controls;
public partial class DictionaryCommandButton : Button
{
	public static Dictionary<string, ICommand> Commands = new Dictionary<string, ICommand>();

	// Bind the OnHandle command here. No need to do it in xaml.
	public DictionaryCommandButton() => Command = new Command<string>(OnHandle);
	private async void OnHandle(string key)
	{
		if (Commands.TryGetValue(key, out ICommand? command))
		{
			command?.Execute(this);
		}
		else
		{
			await App.Current.MainPage.DisplayAlert(
				title: "Error", 
				message: "Command not in dictionary",
				cancel: "Got it");
		}
	}
}
```

The goal here is to simplify your xaml syntax, which now looks something more like this:

```
<ContentPage xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/dotnet/2021/maui"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2009/xaml"
             xmlns:controls="clr-namespace:dictionary_button.Controls"
             x:Class="dictionary_button.MainPage">
    <ScrollView>
        <VerticalStackLayout Padding="30,0" Spacing="25">
            <Image Source="dotnet_bot.png" HeightRequest="185" Aspect="AspectFit" />
            <HorizontalStackLayout HorizontalOptions="CenterAndExpand" Spacing="10">
                <controls:DictionaryCommandButton Text="▲" CommandParameter="Main.Up"/>
                <controls:DictionaryCommandButton Text="▼" CommandParameter="Main.Down"/>
                <controls:DictionaryCommandButton Text="►" CommandParameter="Main.Right"/>
                <controls:DictionaryCommandButton Text="◄" CommandParameter="Main.Left"/>
            </HorizontalStackLayout>
        </VerticalStackLayout>
    </ScrollView>
</ContentPage>
```

#### Mapping

Now, since you can add commands from a `View`, from a generic type constructor, from "anywhere", you can set up the commands from the start. The commands are simple in this example, but they don't have to be. For example, a command implementation in a view model might dynamically inspect the value of other menus or checkboxes before ultimately performing the context-sensitive action. But this should give you the idea:

```
public partial class MainPage : ContentPage
{
    public MainPage()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        // ANY view or type can preload its commands into the static dictionary.
        DictionaryCommandButton.Commands["Main.Up"] = DisplayUp;
        DictionaryCommandButton.Commands["Main.Down"] = DisplayDown;
        DictionaryCommandButton.Commands["Main.Left"] = DisplayLeft;
        DictionaryCommandButton.Commands["Main.Right"] = DisplayRight;
    }
    ICommand DisplayUp { get; } = new Command(async() =>
    {
        await App.Current.MainPage.DisplayAlert(
            title: "Handled!",
            message: "You clicked Up",
            cancel: "Got it");
    });
    ICommand DisplayDown { get; } = new Command(async () =>
    {
        await App.Current.MainPage.DisplayAlert(
            title: "Handled!",
            message: "You clicked Down",
            cancel: "Got it");
    });
    ICommand DisplayLeft { get; } = new Command(async () =>
    {
        await App.Current.MainPage.DisplayAlert(
            title: "Handled!",
            message: "You clicked Left",
            cancel: "Got it");
    });
    ICommand DisplayRight { get; } = new Command(async () =>
    {
        await App.Current.MainPage.DisplayAlert(
            title: "Handled!",
            message: "You clicked Right",
            cancel: "Got it");
    });
}
```

I hope this is helpful.
